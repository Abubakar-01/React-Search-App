A modern React application for searching and displaying images with a clean, intuitive interface. This app provides real-time image search functionality with responsive design and optimized performance.

## Features

- 🔍 Real-time image search functionality
- 📱 Responsive design that works on all devices
- ⚡ Fast and optimized performance
- 🎨 Clean and modern user interface
- 🖼️ Grid-based image display layout

## Technologies Used

- **React 18.2.0** - Modern React with hooks
- **Axios** - HTTP client for API requests
- **CSS3** - Custom styling and responsive design
- **Create React App** - Build tooling and development server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abubakar-01/React-Search-App.git
   cd React-Search-App
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes - your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
